# hello-world

First time using GitHub - Following website instructions

William here, I want to learn how to code.
Specialy, I will start following a Caelum's apostille, and doing so I want to use GitHub to save my lessons.

Code: 

public class MyFirstClass {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("HelloWorld");
  }
}
